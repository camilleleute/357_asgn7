### CSC 357 Assignment 7 - Pipes

Purpose:
- This assignment involves implementing a parallel merge sort using processes in C, utilizing pipes for interprocess communication. The goal is to understand process creation, management, and interprocess communication using pipes.

Ground Rules:
- Code must compile without memory leaks using gcc and valgrind.
- The program must be compatible with the Cal Poly UNIX servers, using only POSIX-compliant system calls and library functions.

Parallel Merge Sort:
- Implement a function in fsort.c to sort an array using a parallel merge sort approach:
- The array is recursively divided into halves, creating a new process to sort each half.
- For even-length arrays, the first half is sorted in the parent process and the second half in a child process.
- For odd-length arrays, the first half is sorted in the parent process, and the child process handles the slightly larger second half.
- If fork() fails during the creation of a child process, the array should be left in its partially sorted state, and the function must return 1. Otherwise, it should return 0.

Interprocess Communication with Pipes:
- Child processes have their own copy of the unsorted array in memory. Once sorted, they send the results back to the parent process via a pipe.
- It is assumed that each element fits within the pipe, but thereâ€™s no assumption about the entire array fitting at once, so the function must handle partial data transfers as needed.

Using void Pointer Offsets:
- The function operates on arrays of any type, requiring void pointers and the size of each element for proper indexing.
- Pointers are cast to char* to handle generic memory manipulation based on the width of each element.

Key System Calls and Functions:
- The assignment suggests using the following:
- pipe, read, and write: For interprocess communication.
- memcpy: To copy data between buffers when merging sorted subarrays.

Testing and Compilation:
- The function will be tested with unit tests in fsorttests.c. It must pass these tests, which check the correctness of the sorting function and its handling of child processes.
- The fsort.c code must be compiled into an object file and then linked into a static archive (fsort.a) for efficient distribution.
